Hi! My name is Chun Li, and this is my blog.

I have a Bachelors of Computer Science from the University of Waterloo, and am
currently living in Toronto with my black moggy Chio. He likes to stay up with
me when I work late at night, but doesn't always manage to stay awake! :smile:

I like solving puzzles and building things. Otherwise, I also enjoy reading,
deep talks with Alli, and cooking (also my cat!).
