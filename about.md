Hi! My name is Chun Li, and this is my blog.

I have a Bachelors of Computer Science from the University of Waterloo,
and a black cat Pistachio (although I call him Chio). I enjoy learning, playing
with my cat, hanging out with my girlfriend Allison, and cooking.

I currently work at [Google](https://www.google.com) in San Francisco.

### Past Work

I went to the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com) in Brooklyn, where I studied
functional programming and read SICP.

I used to work at [BiblioCommons](https://www.bibliocommons.com/) as
a backend engineer.

I interned at [Yext](https://www.yext.com) twice.

I interned at [Reflektion](http://www.reflektion.com) as well.
