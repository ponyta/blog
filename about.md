Hi! My name is Chun Li, and this is my blog.

I have a Bachelors of Computer Science from the University of Waterloo, and am
currently living in Toronto with my black moggy Chio. He likes to stay up with
me when I work late at night, but doesn't always manage to stay awake! :smile:

I like solving puzzles and building things. Otherwise, I also enjoy
reading, playing with my cat, deep talks with Alli, and cooking.

I currently work at [BiblioCommons](https://www.bibliocommons.com/) as
a backend engineer. Feel free to check out my
[Github](https://www.github.com/ponyta) and my [personal git
server](https://git.chunli.me). My [website](https://chunli.me) is
currently under construction, sorry!
