Hi! My name is Chun Li, and this is my blog.

I have a Bachelors of Computer Science from the University of Waterloo,
and a black cat Pistachio (although I call him Chio). He likes to stay up
with me when I work late at night, but doesn't always manage to stay
awake!

I enjoy reading, playing with my cat, walks with my girlfriend Allison, and cooking.

I currently work at Google in San Francisco.

### Past Work

I went to the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com) in Brooklyn, where I studied
functional programming and read SICP!

I used to work at [BiblioCommons](https://www.bibliocommons.com/) as
a backend engineer.

I interned at [Yext](https://www.yext.com) twice.

I interned at [Reflektion](http://www.reflektion.com) as well.

Feel free to check out my [Github](https://www.github.com/ponyta), my
[personal git server](https://git.chunli.me), and my
[website](https://chunli.me).
