Today is the first day of my 3 month batch at the [Recurse
Center](https://www.recurse.com/)! Last month, I quit working at
BiblioCommons to pursue new opportunities and dedicate the next 3 months
to growing as a programmer. It's quite overwhelming and scary (I've met so
many new people in the last 24 hours!), but also exciting.

It's been a month of big changes for me: I moved out of my apartment by
the St. Lawrence Market, I left my cat in Markham with my parents, I flew
to Brooklyn, I've moved between multiple AirBnB's, I've barely had time to
do laundry, and now I'm saying goodbye to my girlfriend for the next
3 months. It doesn't seem like too much on paper, but I think it's all
hitting me suddenly. I've met a ton of new friendly people, and yet
suddenly I feel very much alone.

Regardless, I definitely want to try and make the most of my time here.
I want to blog much more (I just found out about iron blogger, although
I'm a little nervous my posts will be so low quality, people will think
I'm attempting to cheat my way out), preferably at least once a week, even
if it's not about programming. Here are some other things I would
definitely like to finish here:

* Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs
* Writing a simple database
* Writing a simple interpreter, perhaps by finishing "Writing an
  Interpreter in Go"

There are also a few things I might want to do, but I'm not sure if
they're important (either because they're worries I have about job prep,
or maybe not the best use of my time here):

* Android Development (just curious)
* Front-end development
* Practicing interview questions (for the job hunt after)

Anyways, I just hope this first week will be productive. I'm a whole bag
of emotions right now. I'm going to miss my girlfriend a ton, but I'm also
super excited. I feel like I'm on the edge of the cliff, and part of me is
saying "just go home, your bed is nice and warm and cozy." But the call of
the void is strong, and the other part of me is telling me to just jump.

Hopefully, the fall takes me somewhere great.
