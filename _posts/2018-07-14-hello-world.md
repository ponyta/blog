It look me way more effort than was necessary, but I've got most of the
infrastructure for my new website up and running. Nobody probably noticed,
but I ended up scrapping Ghost after it refused to work with the newly
installed MySQL 8, and didn't bother recovering the old blog posts.
They're still buried a database table somewhere, but honestly there wasn't
anything worth recovering.

I am going to start a tutorial on how I set up this site though, since
I actually learned a decent amount through the process. Who knows, maybe
someday someone will find it useful.
